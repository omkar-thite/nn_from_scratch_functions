# nn_from_scratch
Neural network implementation from scratch using python functions.

- Most of the code is inspired by deeplearning specialization on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) from deeplearning.ai.
- Some modifications are made for generalization and vectorization.
- NN is implemented in procedural approach (not OOP).
- Classification application is implemented in separate notebook which illustrates nn implementation.
  - Dataset is synthesized using sklearn library.
  - Classification is only for demonstration purpose.
- This is academic project.

Any comments, suggestions or imprpovements are always welcome.
Thank you for visiting.
